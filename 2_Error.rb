This error message indicates that your local branch is behind the remote branch on GitHub. This happens when changes have been made to the repository on GitHub, and you need to sync your local branch with the remote branch before pushing your changes. To resolve this issue, you should follow these steps:

Pull Changes from Remote:

Use the following command to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to your local branch:
css
Copy code
git pull origin main
Replace "main" with the name of the branch you are working on (e.g., "master" if you are using the "master" branch).
Resolve Conflicts (If Any):

If there are any conflicts between the changes you pulled and your local changes, you will need to resolve them manually. Your code editor or Git client should guide you through resolving conflicts.
After resolving conflicts, add the changed files using git add and then commit the changes using git commit.
Push Your Changes Again:

Once you have pulled the latest changes and resolved any conflicts, you can try pushing your changes again:
css
Copy code
git push origin main
This will push your local changes to the remote branch on GitHub.
Consider Force Push (If Necessary):

If you are the sole contributor to the repository and are sure that you want to overwrite the remote branch with your local changes, you can use force push with the -f flag:
css
Copy code
git push -f origin main
However, be cautious when using force push, as it can lead to data loss if not used correctly. Only use it when you are confident in what you are doing.
After following these steps, your local and remote branches should be in sync, and you should be able to push your changes to the remote repository without any issues. If you continue to encounter problems, double-check your remote repository URL and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository.
