This warning message indicates that there are line-ending differences between your local working copy and the GitHub repository. Git is detecting that some files in your working directory have LF (Line Feed) line endings, while the corresponding files in the GitHub repository have CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) line endings.

This often happens when you are working on a project on both Windows and non-Windows platforms, as Windows uses CRLF line endings by default, while Unix-based systems use LF line endings.

To resolve this issue, you need to configure Git to handle line endings correctly. Heres how you can do it:

Configure Git Line Endings:
Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt to configure Git:

For Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):

css
Copy code
git config --global core.autocrlf input
For Windows:

arduino
Copy code
git config --global core.autocrlf true
The core.autocrlf setting automatically converts line endings as you commit and checkout files, ensuring consistent line endings in the repository.

Recommit the Files:
After configuring Gits line endings, you need to recommit the affected files. Run the following commands:

sql
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Fix line endings"
git push origin main
Replace "main" with the name of the branch you are working on.

These steps should fix the line-ending differences and allow you to commit and push your changes to GitHub without any warnings. Its important to ensure consistent line endings in the repository to avoid conflicts and unexpected behavior when collaborating with others across different platforms.
